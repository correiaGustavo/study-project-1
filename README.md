# study-project-1
First JavaScript study project. A small game where the user tries to guess the secret number.

# Discover the Number

This is my first study project using JavaScript. It's a simple game where the user has to guess a randomly generated secret number.

## About the Project

- I developed the JavaScript logic from scratch.
- The HTML and CSS were provided by the course.
- I made some visual adjustments to the original layout to practice and apply soft skills like creativity and initiative.

## Technologies

- JavaScript
- HTML (provided)
- CSS (provided)

## Purpose

To practice programming logic and DOM manipulation using JavaScript.

## Disclaimer

The variables, functions, and objects in this project are named in Portuguese, as it is my native language. Although I am fluent in English and learning programming primarily in English, I chose to write the code in Portuguese to support my learning process. Additionally, the courses I am currently taking are taught in Portuguese.
